### Multiple Hypothesis Dropout

This codebase implements Multiple Hypothesis Dropout and Mixture of Multiple-Output Functions (MoM).

Please install pytorch==1.7 and the packages listed under requirements.txt before using.

The notebooks reproduce experiments presented in the paper submission for AAAI. 

The models folder contains implementations of the proposed neural networks. 

The code for MH-VQ is undergoing development and will be released as part of a seperate git repository.
